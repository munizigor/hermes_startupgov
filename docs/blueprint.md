## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: CBMDF red (#D32F2F), symbolizing emergency services. This vibrant hue captures immediate attention and represents urgency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) providing a clean and neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain for operators during extended use.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#FF9800) intended for interactive elements and to highlight important information. It complements the primary color and increases usability.
- Clean, sans-serif font (such as Roboto or Open Sans) for optimal readability, especially important in a high-stress environment.
- Two-column grid layout to show transcript + form on left; Google Map + alert badges on right
